0. Introduction
   This file will show you how to build the RTL8197H linux system.
   Besides, It will guide you how to download the built image to Realtek EV (Evaluation) board 
   for testing. PLEASE NOTE, the download image will overwrite the original image existed in the 
   flash memory of EV board.

1. Build Environment
	CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)
	Ubuntu 16.04

2. Quick start
   - tar -jxvf rtl819x.tar.bz2
   - cd rtl819x/
   - make menuconfig:
	--for SPINAND_RTL8197F_VG_8832BR_8367R_Kernel4.4_GW
		Selected Target (rtl8197F)
		Selected Kernel (linux-4.4)
		Selected Busybox (busybox-1.24.1)
		Selected toolchain (msdk-6.4.1-mips-EL-4.4-u0.9.33-m32ut-190619)
		Selected Board Configuration (SPINAND RTL8197F_VG/8832BR+8367R Kernel4.4 GW)
		Select Load default settings

	--for SPINAND_RTL8197F_VG_8832BR_8367R_Kernel4.4_GW_EASYMESH
		Selected Target (rtl8197F)
		Selected Kernel (linux-4.4)
		Selected Busybox (busybox-1.24.1)
		Selected toolchain (msdk-6.4.1-mips-EL-4.4-u0.9.33-m32ut-190619)
		Selected Board Configuration (SPINAND RTL8197F_VG/8832BR+8367R Kernel4.4 GW_EASYMESH)
		Select Load default settings

	
   - make
	
3. make image
   there are four steps for making image:
   - make users
     build the users applications
   - make linux
     build the kernel files
   - make romfs
     copy all the application binary files into romfs
   - make image
     compress the root.bin and linux.bin

4. build bootloader
   - cd rtl819x-SDK-v3.6.0-full-package
   - tar jxvf rtl819x-SDK-v3.6.0-bootcode.tar.bz2
   - cd bootcode
   - ensure the source code of sdk is existent, do command "tar -jxvf rtl819x.tar.bz2" first, it include the toolchain.
   - add environment variable(assume you source code directory is /rtl819x-SDK-v3.6.0-full-package/bootcode):
       --for rtl8197F
                 "PATH=$PATH:../rtl819x/toolchain/msdk-4.4.7-mips-EL-3.10-u0.9.33-m32t-140827/bin"

   - cp def-rtl8197fh_vg_8367rb_vc-spi_nand-config .config (It will do the default setting for rtl8197F bootcode.)
   - make menuconfig:
   - Exit and Save	
   - make 
   - you will find boot.bin in ./btcode_vg
   - 'boot.bin' is the bootloader image

5. binary file list
   - rtl819x/image/fw.bin                    : the image include root.bin,linux.bin and webpages-gw.bin
    	  
6. Download image files to Realtek EV (evaluation) board for testing
   - Use a RS232 cable to connect COM port between a LINUX PC and EV board.
   - Connect LINUX PC Ethernet port to the LAN port of EV board. Set PC IP
     address to 192.168.1.x (e.g., type 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1').
   - Start a COM port console (e.g., minicom), and set COM port setting to
     38400, 8N1 and no flow control.
   - Power on EV board, and press 'ESC' key in COM port console to escape the
     booting process. If ok, you may see "<RealTek>" prompt in the console.
   - Start a TFTP client in LINUX PC, and connect to 192.168.1.6. Set file
     type to binary mode to TFTP server of EV board, put root.bin if gw 
     platform to TFTP server, and put root image file(rtl819x/image/root.bin) to TFTP server,
     then put the webpages image file and  linux image files to TFTP server.
     After linux.bin file upload had finished, boot code will auto booting.
   - NOTE:you can do the same thing on Windos PC.

7. Build ramdisk for MP using "root" user
   - modify /etc/fstab
     vim /etc/fstab
     add "/dev/ram /mnt/ramdisk ext2 suid,noauto,user,rw     0 0" in the file
   - cd /mnt
     mkdir ramdisk
   - cd /bin
     chmod +s mknod
   - cd /dev
     ln -sf ram1 ram

NOTE:
   - In order to create dev file in romfs, /bin/mknod should be suid.
     Do the command "chmod +s /bin/mknod" as root privilege.
   - If you don't use the default setting to make bootcode, make sure the size of boot.bin is less than 128K.
